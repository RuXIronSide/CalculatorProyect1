# Gunnar's Calculator

Welcome to Gunnar's Calculator! This is a modern, user-friendly calculator web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript designed to perform basic and slightly advanced arithmetic operations with a smooth and intuitive interface.

##

## Project Overview

This calculator project consists of a clean, stylish interface that adapts well to different screen sizes and offers powerful usability features based on JavaScript functionality.

##

### Key Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Advanced Input Support:** Parentheses, decimal numbers, and real math symbols (×, ÷).
- **Clear and Intuitive UI:** Large, rounded buttons with distinct colors for numbers, operators, and utility keys.
- **Responsive Design:** Layout adapts smoothly for mobile and desktop screens using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully displays errors if the user inputs invalid math expressions.
- **Keyboard Support:** Use computer keyboard for all operations, including numbers, operators, parentheses, Enter (=), Escape (clear), and Backspace.
- **Input Validation:** Prevents invalid sequences like double operators or multiple decimals in a number.
- **Easy Correction:** Backspace lets users remove the last input character without clearing everything.
- **Read-Only Display:** Protects the input display from uncontrolled manual typing, restricting entries to validated input paths.

##

## Project Structure

- **index.html:** Contains the calculator layout with buttons and the display.
- **styles.css:** Provides modern, glassmorphic-inspired styling with shadows, gradients, and interactive effects.
- **index.js:** Implements core calculator logic, user input validation, keyboard support, error handling, and display management.

##

## How to Use

- Click or tap buttons to enter your calculation.
- Use the keyboard for fast input — numbers, symbols, parentheses, Enter to calculate, Escape to clear, and Backspace to delete.
- The display updates accordingly, showing errors if something goes wrong.
- Press Equals (=) button or Enter key to calculate the result.

##

## Installation & Running Locally

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` with any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
3. Start calculating instantly — no additional setup needed.

##

## Future Improvements

- Add history of calculations.
- Implement scientific calculator functions (sin, cos, sqrt).
- Add theme switcher for light/dark modes.
- Improve accessibility with ARIA roles and better screen reader support.
